    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
   <p>I want to help people find what they are passionate about and ease the stress of research. Part of the intimidation comes from not feeling smart enough to read research let alone participate in innovative research. I want to build others’ confidence in doing research by making it extremely accessible.

   <h3>About The Project</h3>
    <p>about the project
    I want to create videos that break down some of my favorite academic research in an approachable and fun way. My desire is to make “Abstracts by Abbie” into something like Crash Course and SparkNotes but specifically for academic articles, summarizing and exploring research topics within a short and lively video essay that enables viewers from all walks of life to understand the articles. I want my research to not only help more people access and engage with innovative research, but to also change the way academics approach presenting their studies. From the uses of Paleolithic ceramics, to modernist literature’s effect on our understanding of the novel, to new advances in physics, to the symbolism in Beyoncé’s music videos, I want to create an online learning environment that is inviting and exciting.

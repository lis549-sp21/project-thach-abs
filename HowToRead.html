    <h3>Skim!</h3>
    <p>Yes, seriously you are allowed to skim, encouraged even! Here are some tried and true tips for how to skim and not waste your time or energy.</p>
    <p> Before skimming a paper, you should take not of the author(s) and maybe do some preliminary research on their background. Then, read the abstract and thr first and last sentence of paragraphs to get the gist: this is a time saver. Sometimes the paragraphs just have too many words, but if you can at least commit to reading the first and last sentence of each paragraph, you should get a gerneral idea of what is being discussed in the paper. When skimming, pay attention to the visualizations of data and their captions: This is another way to see what the author wants to highlight without reading the whole thing. Lastly, re-read the abstract and remind yourself of what the goal of the pape was!</p>
    
        <h3>A Closer Reading</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Read the title, abstract, and discussion section to determine the conclusion of the study</li>
            <li>Read the introduction and the literature review to determine what the research question is and what the research will contribute to the field.</li>
            <li>Read the findings, sometimes results, and analysis sections. Consider what type of information is present and how it is reported. Do the results make sense?</li>
            <li> Read and consider the methods of the study. Do you agree with the subjects and variables the researcher picked?</li>
            <li>Upon rereading the conclusion, do you accept or reject the conclusion? Would you have done anything differently? Take note of any outstanding questions you have
